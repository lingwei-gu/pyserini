{"id": "CACM-2274", "contents": "Generating English Discourse from Semantic Networks A system is described for generating English sentences from a form of semantic nets in which the nodes are word-sense meanings and the paths are primarily deep case relations. The grammar used by the system is in the form of a network that imposes an ordering on a set of syntactic transformations that are expressed as LISP functions. The generation algorithm uses the information in the semantic network to select appropriate generation paths through the grammar. The system is designed for use as a computational tool that allows a linguist to develop and study methods for generating surface strings from an underlying semantic structure. Initial finding with regard to form determiners such as voice, form, tense, and mood, some rules for embedding sentences, and some attention to pronominal substitution are reported. The system is programmed in LISP 1.5 and is available from the authors. CACM October, 1972 Simmons, R.

{"id": "CACM-0981", "contents": "Rounding Problems in Commercial Data Processing A common requirement in commercial data processing is that the sum of a set of numbers, rounded in a generally understood manner, be equal to the sum of the numbers rounded individually. Four rounding procedures are described to accomplish this. The particular procedure that is appropriate depends upon whether the numbers being accumulated can vary in sign, whether their sum can vary in sign, and whether the last number being summed can be recognized as such prior to its rounding.
